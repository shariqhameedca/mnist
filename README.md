# MNIST - Digit Recognizer <br>
**The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9** <br> <hr>
In this notebook, I explored the mnist dataset which contains thousands of handwritten digits. I did preprocessing and used different ML models. I evaluated these models using different techniques, In the end, I did error analysis for the predictions made.
